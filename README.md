# NYC Vehicle Stops Visualization
New York City, known as the Big Apple, is one of the world's most vibrant and populated cities, filled with bustling streets, diverse communities, and never-ending hustle. With its millions of residents and visitors, the city's roads see a high traffic volume daily. As such, this analysis pinpoints the major hotspot of frequent vehicle stops and checks to see if it varies with time and demography.

Mapping out the city with high-stop locations and analyzing trends can provide insight to city officials and law enforcement agencies during policy-making and resource allocation to address disparities and community concerns
